# Angry Birds
This project is an Angry Birds-like game developed using the Flame engine and Forge2D in Flutter. 
The game features a slingshot mechanism, obstacles, and pigs that players must knock down to win levels. 
The project demonstrates collision detection, game state management, and the use of overlays to handle different game states such as winning or losing a level.

## Features
- Slingshot Mechanism: Drag and release the player to launch it towards the obstacles and pigs.
- Obstacles: Various obstacles are placed in the game world that the player must navigate to hit the pigs.
- Collision Detection: Detects when pigs fall to the ground, triggering the game state change.
- Game Overlays: Includes overlays for game states such as 'Game Won' and 'Game Lost.'
- Score System: Players earn points by successfully knocking pigs to the ground.
- Level Progression: Players advance to the next level upon successfully completing the current level.
